# PIC32PMP

Explore the PIC32's Parallel Master Port on a PIC250F256L dev board.
Millisecond timer interrupt generated by Timer 1,
which also toggles RA7.
PMP sends four bytes to CS1 and four bytes to CS2.
Data bus is eight bits wide and has two address lines.
Sends characters to USART3 depending on SW1 state.

Note that we have two HMDL-2416 displays, so PMCS1 goes to the left-hand
one and PMCS2 goes to the right-hand one.
The data bus PMD[0-7] and the address bus PMA[0-1] connects to both
displays in parallel, as does PMWR.
PMRD is not connected (the displays are write-only) and nor is PMD7
(they're 7-bit ASCII).
Some pins on the HMDL-2416 displays are tied HIGH or LOW.

PIC32 pin numbers are for the 100-pin package.

LEDs light when the pin is pulled LOW.
