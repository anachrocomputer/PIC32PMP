# PIC32PMP

Explore the PIC32's Parallel Master Port on a PIC250F256L dev board.
Millisecond timer interrupt generated by Timer 1,
which also toggles RA7.
Sends characters to USART3 depending on SW1 state,
generates PWM on OC1 and OC2.
Two SPI channels configured to send data, SPI2 at 2MHz and SPI3 at 1MHz.
SPI2 sends a 16-bit word every 22.6us (44.1kHz).
SPI3 sends variable-length packets at certain times in the main loop.
