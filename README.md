# PIC32PMP

Explore the PIC32's Parallel Master Port on a PIC250F256L dev board.
Millisecond timer interrupt generated by Timer 1,
which also toggles RA7.
PMP sends four bytes to CS1 and four bytes to CS2.
Data bus is eight bits wide and has two address lines.
Sends characters to USART3 depending on SW1 state.
