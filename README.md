# PIC32PMP

Explore the PIC32's Parallel Master Port on a PIC250F256L dev board.
Millisecond timer interrupt generated by Timer 1,
which also toggles RA7.
Sends characters to USART3 depending on SW1 state,
generates PWM on OC1 and OC2.

* LED1 RA6, P3 pin 41
* LED2 RB9, P2 pin 33, P5 or D4
* Timer toggle at 500Hz RA7, P3 pin 42
* U3TX RC1 pin 6, P2 pin 6
* U3RX RC4 pin 9, P2 pin 9
* SW1 RA1 pin 38, P2 pin 38, pulled HIGH, LOW when pressed
* PWM  RD8/OC1 pin 68
* PWM  RD0/OC2 pin 72

PIC32 pin numbers are for the 100-pin package.

LEDs light when the pin is pulled LOW.
